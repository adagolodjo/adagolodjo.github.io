Hi there! My name is [Yinoussa Adagolodjo] and I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Lille. I have a strong background in mathematics and have always been interested in applying my knowledge to practical problems.

After completing my MSc in Mathematics at the University of Lomé in 2011, I taught mathematics for a year at a local high school. In 2012, I moved to France to pursue my studies in Mathematical Engineering and obtained a master's degree in Scientific Computing and High Performance Computing in 2014.

After working as an engineer for three months, I began my PhD in Medical Robotics and Simulation at the AVR/ICube-MIMESIS/INRIA teams in 2015. During my PhD, I participated in the CONECT project and successfully defended my thesis in 2018.

Following my PhD, I worked as a Research Engineer at the MIMESIS team, where I developed an augmented reality tool for open liver surgery. In March 2019, I joined the INRIA research team, Defrost, as a Research Engineer on the SES project. From June 2020 to August 2022, I was a postdoctoral fellow on the ROBOCOP project (robotization of cochlear implants) and contributed to the European project CoBra and COSSEROOTS.

I am passionate about using my knowledge and skills to improve healthcare and make a positive impact on society. On this website, you can find more information about my research, education, and experience. Thank you for visiting!


<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
