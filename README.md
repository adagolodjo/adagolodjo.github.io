Hi there! My name is [Yinoussa Adagolodjo] and I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Lille. I have a strong background in mathematics and have always been interested in applying my knowledge to practical problems.

After completing my MSc in Mathematics at the University of Lom√© in 2011, I taught mathematics for a year at a local high school. In 2012, I moved to France to pursue my studies in Mathematical Engineering and obtained a master's degree in Scientific Computing and High Performance Computing in 2014.

After working as an engineer for three months, I began my PhD in Medical Robotics and Simulation at the AVR/ICube-MIMESIS/INRIA teams in 2015. During my PhD, I participated in the CONECT project and successfully defended my thesis in 2018.

Following my PhD, I worked as a Research Engineer at the MIMESIS team, where I developed an augmented reality tool for open liver surgery. In March 2019, I joined the INRIA research team, Defrost, as a Research Engineer on the SES project. From June 2020 to August 2022, I was a postdoctoral fellow on the ROBOCOP project (robotization of cochlear implants) and contributed to the European project CoBra and COSSEROOTS.

I am passionate about using my knowledge and skills to improve healthcare and make a positive impact on society. On this website, you can find more information about my research, education, and experience. Thank you for visiting!
